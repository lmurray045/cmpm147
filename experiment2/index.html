				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>- Color: the color was decided by the major fields and compositions of the original image. By squinting, one can see the
					fingerprint that the generative scene is built on.<br>
				  - Primitives: both the green trees and the white snowy peaks are made using the triangle primitive. Additionally, both
					grassy fields and the sky are rectangle primitives.<br>
				  - Polygons:The mountains with peaks are made using vertexes that are extended horizontally by a random width to create
					the base on which the peaks sit. Additionally, the dark foothill is a randomly made vertex based polygon.<br>
				  - Composition: The mountains, peaks, foothills, and trees all change based on a random number generated from the seed.<br>
				  - Life: the image is meant to capture the feeling of leaving beauty behind. As such, the scene slowly pulls away from you,
					farther and farther. The viewer can also pan left and right to cycle the days, to show how as time passes, everything ultimately fades.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am the only person who worked on this project. Generally, it was not particularly difficult. After reading the documentation
					for p5.js, it was pretty straightfoward. For a while, I struggled with making it my own, and trying to create an original piece
					of art that reflected my own personal values. In the end, however, I feel like I ultimately achieved that which I am proud of.
