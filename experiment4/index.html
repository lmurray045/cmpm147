				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to mega artist, a infinite canvas with randomized paint! Move your mouse to paint the screen, and click to change colors.
					It goes on forever, so go nuts!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					This project uses a provided rendering engine to place and paint tiles to make the canvas. I use tile indexing 
					and hover detection to place color where the mouse moves. Additionally, I used a hash function to create random,
					replicateable worlds based on a string seed.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This project was honestly difficult and tedious. The code base that was provided to us was hard to understand,
					and much of the time involved was spent trying to figure out what was going on. After finishing something I was
					proud of, then having to repeat it two more times really took it out of me. Overall, I feel like I did learn, but
					as much as I could have if had been able to focus my attention to one project.
