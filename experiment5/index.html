				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The experiment is designed as a way to practice generative design and adaptation, and it uses a mutation algorithm to discover the best image generation parameters of a set algorithm.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project uses mutated hyperparameters to create a grid of points, which are then rendered as triangles using p5.js. First, it loops over random sub-areas of the image in order to store the coordinates of each selected point. Then, each triangle is given a color based on the area it covers, which is then rendered onto the canvas. The number of points, density of triangles, and the size of the triangles are determined by the mutation function.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am the only person who worked on this project. This project was difficult and hard to get working the way I wanted, but I am very proud of the result. It turned out better than I had expected, and it generates a very cool pixelation pattern. The issues I encountered were mostly related to run time, as its a very computationally expensive algorithm.</p>
