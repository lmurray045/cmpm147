				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The experiment is designed as a way to practice level generation and bitmapping, and to create a coherent scene that maintains interesting and widely variable generation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project uses p5.js to create a grid of text codes, which are then editted to create structures. First, it loops over random sub-areas of the grid in order to create the planter boxes. Then, the paths are generated by picking two random points, and using a pathing algorithm to connect them. Finally, the puddles are generated with random locations and variations. The varying textures of each tile are created using a bitmap.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am the only person who worked on this project. The main difficulties of this project came when I tried to generate structures on the map. I had a lot of difficulty setting parameters in such a way that allowed for interesting variation, while still maintaining intelligibility. Additionally, mapping each texture to a specific offset to create the bitmap was very tedious.</p>
