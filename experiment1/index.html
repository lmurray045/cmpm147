				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A generator for satircal Amazon training email materials.

					This idea was inspired by my time as a target employee, and by the infamously terrible working conditions of Amazon factories. Employee training is a near universal experience, and often the videos and emails can seem predatory or misleading.
					
					This generator is designed to create comedic examples of what a terrible training video or email might sound like. So, dive in and enjoy the horribly written dialouge and tone deaf descriptions of real workplace issues: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQeGBHxIyHw
					
					And remember: No Unions!!!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I imitated Professor Wes Modes's "Bad Quest Generator" by creating a new template
					and new fill-ins to make an Amazon-themed training material generator. I then ported this 
					from glitch to this portfolio website.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am the only person who worked on this project. Generally, this was pretty straightforward. 
					The instructions were pretty easy to understand and follow, and I appreciated the tight guidance.
					I enjoyed the creative freedom allowed in the generator itself, and found great humor in making it.
					I am pretty unfamiliar with HTML, so the porting to Git was a bit difficult. However, I got it working.
					Additionally, the formatting from Glitch did not port over, which was very frustrating.
